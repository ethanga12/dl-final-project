## Project Check in 3
<!-- Just writing this in here so we can copy paste this into the devpost. This will be deleted later on - Riki -->

**Instructions:** For this checkin, we also require you to write up a reflection including the following:  
**Introduction:** This can be copied from the proposal.  
**Challenges** What has been the hardest part of the project youâ€™ve encountered so far?  
**Insights:** Are there any concrete results you can show at this point?   
How is your model performing compared with expectations?  
**Plan:** Are you on track with your project?  
What do you need to dedicate more time to?  
What are you thinking of changing, if anything?
